    <!-- Chosen Palette: Classic Mystery -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A SPA with tab-based navigation (Home, Characters, The Investigation, The Solution, Quiz) was designed to allow non-linear, thematic access to the content. This structure is superior to a linear document for studying, as it allows the user to focus on specific areas of interest. Interactivity, such as expandable character dossiers and a practice quiz, transforms passive reading into active learning. The goal is to improve information retention and preparation for an oral exam through direct user engagement with the material. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Characters: Information (Passenger List) -> Goal (Organize/Inform) -> Presentation (Interactive card grid) -> Interaction (Click to reveal details in a modal) -> Justification (More engaging and focused than a static table, facilitates learning each character individually) -> Method (HTML/Tailwind/JS).
        - Clues: Information (List of false and real clues) -> Goal (Organize/Inform) -> Presentation (Interactive clue board) -> Interaction (Click on a clue icon to see its description) -> Justification (Simulates the investigation process and reinforces the idea of deliberate deception) -> Method (HTML/Tailwind/JS).
        - Solutions: Information (Poirot's two theories) -> Goal (Compare/Inform) -> Presentation (Switchable tab view) -> Interaction (Buttons to toggle between Solution 1 and Solution 2) -> Justification (Clearly contrasts the lie and the truth, the novel's climax) -> Method (HTML/Tailwind/JS).
        - Quiz: Information (Exam question bank) -> Goal (Engage/Reinforce) -> Presentation (Flashcard-style quiz) -> Interaction (Buttons for 'New Question' and 'Reveal Answer') -> Justification (Encourages active memory recall, a very effective study technique) -> Method (HTML/Tailwind/JS).
        - No data charts (Chart.js/Plotly) are used as the source material is entirely qualitative. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            { q: "Why do you think Poirot decided to lie to the police?", a: "Because he believed that the passengers had delivered a form of justice that the law had failed to provide. He saw Ratchett as a 'wild beast' and the passengers not as criminals, but as people seeking justice for a failed system." }
